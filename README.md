# Congestion Control Mechanism For Wireless Sensor Networks
There are two levels of congestion.
1. At node level
2. At link level

To control node level congestion control, we use compressed sensing theory for reconstruction of the signal. 
A simulation of compressed sensing theory where it selectively chooses some packets to measure by using a random Gaussian distribution function. 

To control link level congestion control, we use maximum spanning tree algorithm which is based on Kruskal's alogrithm but reversed. It helps the node select appropriate channels according to the size of the signal.
